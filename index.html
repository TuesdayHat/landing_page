            <h4>Interests</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Tabletop Gaming
              <p>The </em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> game I'm part of has been going for nearly 7 years, and its rules are nearly unrecognizable from the original, from the GM and I having frequent discussions picking apart the system and what makes it tick. Favorite systems are <em>DnD 3.5</em>(sorta) and <em>Shadowrun</em> 4th edition. Do not ask about <em>Pathfinder</em>. </p></li>
              <li><em>Art</em>
                <p><strong><==</strong> There's an entire page for it.</p>
                <p>I primarily do artwork in Pen & Ink with ink wash, and occasionally watercolor. <img class="art" src="img/IMG_0333.jpg" alt="man in a hat"><br> As a personal challenge I decided I would finish at least one drawing every day at Epicodus before lunch is out. My Artwork page has a few things from the last time I organized a portfolio.</p></li>
              <li>Games
                <p>More generally than just tabletop; I'm interested in what makes a rule set work, whether they're absolute like in a videogame or more of a suggenstion that all participants agree to follow because it makes the proess more enjoyable. Because that's all games <em>are</em>, at their core -- you've agreed to follow rules when you don't have to for no benefit other than that the <em>act of following those rules</em> is more enjoyble than not doing that.</p></li>
              <li>History
                <p>Not much in the way of formal instruction, more filing away a hoard of useless trivia with a focus on trying to come up with an overview of <em>why</em> the world looks the way it does now</p></li>
