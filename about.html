        <div class="about">
          <p>I was born in Baltimore, MD and have moved around the US ever since. Now I'm in Portland for the forseeable future, which, admittedly, isn't terribly <em>far</em> into the future these days.</p>
          <img id="orange" class="art" src="img/IMG_0370.jpg" alt="image">
          <p>I've spent my entire career both in and out of school oscillating between artwork and programming as <strong>The Plan</strong> for what I thought I'd be doing for the rest of my life, switching from one to the other as either I hit another wall trying to teach myself to code
            <span class="aside">note: disappearing into a cave for days at a time and dedicating the entirity of one's life and attention to learning a new skill does not work as well as one might expect</span>
          or getting another look at what sort of connections and sheer, blind luck are required to break into the art world deep enough to make a living at it. </p>
          <p>Between both extremes and a string of odd jobs and freelance work I was informed that code bootcamps existed as an in between step from going 50 grand in debt for another try at university and becoming a digital monk. And not the sort that knows kung fu.</p>
